# Fire-Detection-System-with-Yolo-v8
🔥 Real-Time Fire Detection System with YOLOv8
This project demonstrates the use of YOLOv8 by Ultralytics and Roboflow to create a real-time fire detection system capable of detecting fire in videos and live camera feeds.

🚀 Features
Dataset Preparation: Managed and preprocessed with Roboflow (Continuous Fire v6).
Model Training:
Base model: yolov8s.pt.
Configurations: 25 epochs, 640x640 image size, and visualized training results.
Testing:
Verified the model's performance on pre-recorded videos.
Real-time fire detection using live camera feed with a confidence threshold of 40%.
Output: Saves detected instances and provides visual feedback in real-time.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
YOLOv8 by Ultralytics for object detection.
Roboflow for dataset preparation.
